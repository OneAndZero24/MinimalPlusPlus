#Minimal++
#Free, open-source and minimallistic C++ IDE for Linux.

#Description
Minimal++ is a completly free and open source(GNU license) project. The main aim of the whole project is to create very minimallistic, yet powerfull and configurable Linux IDE for C++. It offers a basic functionallity of other popular IDEs including:
-text editor
-tree view of directories and files in project
-compiling
-debuging
-editing project structure
It also offers some unusuall functions such as:
-simplicity of UI and usage
-minimallism
-customazibility

#Info
Minimal++ is written in C++. The main library that it is using is Qt 5.4.2(especially for UI). Currently Minimal++ is only for Linux, but later we may link it to other platforms. To run programs Minimal++ is using xterm. Default compilator is g++. Default debuger is gdb.

#Icons
Icon for this program were taken from Eclipse. They are under EPL license. I hope that in the future Minimal++ will have its' own set of icons.

#Usage And Installation
To install it just download executable file from /bin folder. If you are more advanced user you may want to copy all the code and compile it yourself.

All of the controls with short description and their shortcut are in the menu bar. To configure toolbar press litle white icon on it with hint "Customize toolbar.".
